# Lending Club Case Study
The Lending Club dataset involves predicting whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off (defaulted). This is a classic binary classification problem in machine learning. Our goal is to analyze the data, build a predictive model, and derive actionable insights.

## Dataset Details:
In the given dataset, there are 111 columns with total rows as 39717. The data set is from past loan applications which show the status of Default, Current or Fully paid.
We have 2 types of variables:
- One which gives information about the customer behavior while paying the loan.
- Second types of variables are which impact the loan decision for the company like employment length, home ownership, verification status.

## Steps Taken:
The analysis is divided into four main parts:
1. Data cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building & Recommendations

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis conducted across various variables and factors, below are found to be impacting factors for loan default:
1. Address State
2. Home ownership
3. Grades/Sub Grades
4. Purpose of loan and Loan amount
