## General Information

The basis idea for the analysis is to understand the driving factor leading to loan default.

The analysis is divided into four main parts:
1. Data understanding
2. Data cleaning (cleaning missing values, removing columns which are not used for analysis etc.)
3. Data Analysis
4. Recommendations
